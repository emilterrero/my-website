        <p>
        I’ve always had an interest in problem solving and figuring out multiple ways to tackle one problem, as well as kept a strong connection to my creativity; as a Front- End developer, I find these two aspects meet in the middle. As a creative thinker and problem solver, I often find myself laying out my ideas/solutions on paper or whiteboard to show my thinking and creative process. Often times I don’t follow the outline exactly but it allows me to lay out the basic ideas and start working from a strong foundation. Once my creative flow is moving, I am pushed by many things and ideas; I find inspiration from the simplest to the most complex things. I enjoy laying out complex ideas to the basic level to understand not just how a system works but how each part of that system plays a role in the entire process. As a front-end developer these parts of me translate into my work; I like to pay strong attention to detail yet I am aware I must focus on the basic solution (MVP) before jumping into details and modifying the project beyond functionality. As a developer I am also open to learning new concepts and ideas; back-end development is not my strongest skill but am willing to learn more than I do now. As a developer a strong virtue to uphold is remain coachable and open to learning more than what you’re strongest at.
